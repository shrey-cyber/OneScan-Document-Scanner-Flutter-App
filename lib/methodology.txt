## METHODOLOGIES
We have adopted the single platform development approach for this project, our target platform being Android and our preferred framework as Flutter. 
For development practices, we tried to adhere to different principles of AGILE development paradigm to the best of our abilities. Let us elaborate on them.
The apps we see in the app market can be divided into several types of categories, but from a development approach perspective, there are three basic categories. 
The 3 choices have different capabilities and scopes, and we need to choose the right one which satisfies our needs.


There are a lot of doc scanning applications available for mobile platforms but most of them either lack quality or variety in features and filters they provide. 
On top of this most of these applications demand login data and also collect user data, which compromises user security and privacy. 
Also some other applications like OCR and language translation are available separately from the doc scanning applications, whereas
they are often required after scanning a document.
Further, after the ban on widely popular doc scanning utility CamScanner by the Indian government, due to security concerns, other 
apps have been unable to achieve the same quality and variety in features as CamScanner.
